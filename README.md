# Latte

Latte originally began as a project to build a website using solely HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a means to better understand JSONs, but after taking a web development course during my final quarter at college, this project now aims to create a blogging site using React.

The purpose of the site is to allow users to post about technical topics that they find interesting or wish to talk about. These topics may range from the welcoming general -- such as the thought process of character and world design by a concept artist; to overally niche -- such as various operators in esoteric languages.

Whatever the topic, the site hopes to offer a platform where users can write detailed articles sharing particular curiosities.
